        "Hey, welcome to my web! I'm currently working as a mechanical engineer in a startup with one of my professors and mentors from UT. I decided to make a website in ReactJS for fun, and hopefully for you to get to know me a little better.",
        "I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin as a Mechanical Engineer in 2018. I tailored my academic career heavily towards graduate school, and luckily got accepted to Georgia Tech (joint with Seoul National University) and The University of Michigan. But, I decided not to go to graduate school about three weeks before graduation. I feared pigeon-holing myself in career path I hardly know about. So I decided to soul-search in industry.",
        "In June 2018, I started my first job at Tesla as a quality technician for the Model 3 battery module. In October 2018, I received the Quality Employee of the Quarter Award for participating in designing, managing, and leading a pilot production line that saved the company over $10M. After that project, I deployed several applications packaged in Java, Python and MySQL for quick & easy data analysis on manufacturing root-cause analysis. These apps were praised by engineers, managers, and fellow technicians. Soon after, I internally transfered to the Quality Data Science and Systems team for all of Gigafactory 1."

        "Hey, welcome to my web! I'm currently working as a mechanical engineer in a startup with one of my professors and mentors from UT. I decided to make a website in ReactJS for fun, and hopefully for you to get to know me a little better.",
        "I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin as a Mechanical Engineer in 2018. I tailored my academic career heavily towards graduate school, and luckily got accepted to Georgia Tech (joint with Seoul National University) and The University of Michigan. But about three weeks before I graduated, I decided not to go. I feared pigeon-holing myself in career path I hardly knew about. Instead I began soul-searching in industry.",
        "In June 2018, I started my first job at Tesla as a quality technician for the Model 3 battery module. In October 2018, I received the Quality Employee of the Quarter Award for participating in designing, managing, and leading a pilot production line that saved the company over $10M. After that project, I deployed several applications packaged in Java, Python and MySQL for quick & easy data analysis on manufacturing root-cause analysis. These apps were praised by engineers, managers, and fellow technicians. Soon after, I internally transfered to the Quality Data Science and Systems team for all of Gigafactory 1."

        "Legos. My favorite childhood toy. You could literally build anything you could've imagine with merely plastic bricks. There's so many levels of engineering that goes into Legos. From mass manufacturing techniques like injection molding to ",
        "There's two ways to play with Legos; follow the instructions or be creative. Similar to engineers, there are those who never deviate from the process and those were constantly innovate. Both are equally as important, so which one am I? I have the passion to innovate, but lack natural creativity. Instead I take pieces of past experiences and stitch them together to create something new.",
        "Just like legos, I want to stack foundation building blocks together to create something amazing. I chose mechanical engineering because of diversity, ability to solve problems directly, etc. "
